# startElytra / SpawnGlide
> ### This was made for my Minecraft project "Masters of Crafters 2", so I won't update it regularly in the future!
This is a Plugin that allows you to let players glide from the Spawn like in the german youtube projekt "craftattack".  

Version: ``Minecraft Java Edition``  
Tested in: ``1.17.1``
## [Commands](https://github.com/FuntyGithub/startElytra/tree/main/src/main/java/org/funty/startelytra/commands)
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /reload | Realods the config. |
## Geysermc support.
You use any system where bedrock players also can join? The "glidemode" could be buggy in the Minecraft Bedrock Edition, so this plugins gives bedrock players a elytra.
