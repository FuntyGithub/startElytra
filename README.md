# startElytra / SpawnGlide
> ### This was made for my Minecraft project "Masters of Crafters 2", so I won't update it regularly in the future!
This is a Plugin that allows you to let players glide from the Spawn like in the german youtube projekt "craftattack".  

Version: ``Minecraft Java Edition``  
Tested in: ``1.17.1``

## Boost
Glide mode (java players):  ``Press the key to swap items in hands.`` ``(Default: F)``  
Elytra mode (bedrock players):  ``Press the key to sneak.`` ``(Default: Shift)``

## [Commands](https://github.com/FuntyGithub/startElytra/tree/main/src/main/java/org/funty/startelytra/commands)
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /elytra reload | Realods the config. |
## [Geysermc](https://geysermc.org/) support.
You use any system where bedrock players also can join? The "glidemode" could be buggy in the Minecraft Bedrock Edition, so this plugins gives bedrock players a elytra.
